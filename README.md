BilliardBuddy
=============

A SYDE 461 design project for a mediated-reality training system for sports (e.g. billiards).

BilliardBuddy runs on a custom-made mediated-reality headset composed of an Oculus DK2 and 
a stereoscopic vision system constructed from two Logitech C310 webcams modified with
wide-angle (120Â° FOV) lenses, inspired by William Steptoe's AR-Rift project 
(http://willsteptoe.com/post/66968953089/ar-rift-part-1).

BilliardBuddy provides augmented training cues (no pun intended!) to beginner billiards
players, designed to be a more portable alternative to the AR-Pool project (http://arpool.ca/).
